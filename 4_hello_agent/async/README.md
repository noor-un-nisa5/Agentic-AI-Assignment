# 🌐 Urdu Translator Agent using Gemini API (Async)

This project creates an AI-powered translator agent that translates any English sentence into **Urdu**, using **Google Gemini API** with an OpenAI-compatible interface.

It uses the `agents` framework to define a model-based agent, and executes the translation synchronously using `Runner.run_sync()`.
