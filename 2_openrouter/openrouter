🌐 What is OpenRouter?
OpenRouter is a platform that provides unified access to multiple AI language models (LLMs) through a single API.
Think of it as a central hub or “router” that connects you to various powerful AI models from different companies—all in one place.


🔑 Key Points:
One API → Many Models
You can access models like GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, Gemini, etc., using a single OpenRouter API.

Model Switching Made Easy
Instead of signing up for different services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral), you use OpenRouter to try or compare them with one API key.

Pay-as-you-go Pricing
OpenRouter handles billing, so you don’t need separate subscriptions for every provider.

Great for Developers & AI Projects
It's especially helpful when building Agentic AI systems, AI apps, or tools that may benefit from different model strengths (reasoning, creativity, speed, etc.).
